This project was developed for the Containers subject as part of the official university master's degree in Development and Operations (DevOps).
The main objective of this project is to deploy a multi-tier application built on top of several containers orchestrated and deployed using Docker compose technology.
The deployment is based on and is a continuation of the project "Dockerisation of multi-tier application" already uploaded to this portfolio.
